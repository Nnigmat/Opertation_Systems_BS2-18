Physcial address - it is real address where data placed either in primary or second memory.
Virtual address - it is address of data, but it with high probability won't be at this address. We need to add or subtruct offset from it to get real data.

We need virtual address for :
1. Remove problems with little memory size
2. Avoid collisions between two programs which wants to get access to the same address
